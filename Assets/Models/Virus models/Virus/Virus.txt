Greetings,

Here's an upload of a virus. It was initially based on the influenza virus, but there are a lot of interpretations as to what it looks like. 

It was created in Max 2011. The .obj file doesn't map very well and the .3ds doesn't map at all. Probably because I have a raytraced reflection, the Bump is a Mix and the main Diffuse is a Falloff w/the front being Noise.

Standard fare: Free for commercial and non-commercial rendering, but don't sell the model itself; just send more people to ShareCG. :)

Credits are nice, but not necessary.

File list:

Map__5_Mix.tga
Map__6_Falloff.tga
Map__9_Raytrace.tga

virus.3ds
Virus.max [2011]
Virus.mtl
Virus.obj
Virus.txt [duh]



Enjoy!
